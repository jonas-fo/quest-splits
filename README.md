# Quest Splits
This is a plugin, which can split your speedrun times by items recieved

### Usage
In the configuration, you can write the items you want to split by, and the time for that item in the format (item)\_(H:MM:SS.CS),(item)_(H:MM:SS.CS). The hours are optional, and the item can be either the name of the item or item id. If you want no time, write 0:00.00.

#### Examples:
- Egg_1:01.20,Pot of Flour_1:30.20,bucket of milk_0:00.00
- 2400_1:06.50,2401_2:11.40,2399_6:47.90,silverlight_0:00.00
